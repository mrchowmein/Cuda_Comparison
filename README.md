# Cuda_Comparison
Characterizing the performance of OpenMP, OpenCL, CUDA, and OpenACC on GPUs

Abstract
With the rise of utilizing graphics processing units for parallel computing, many different vendors, companies or consortiums have released frameworks to aid developers and computer scientists. We looked at the four popular frameworks and characterized their performance by performing real-world tests. We ran each framework through a series of photo blurring tests. We concluded that directive based libraries such as Ope- nACC and OpenMP trade performance for ease of use. While programming language extension frameworks such as OpenCL and CUDA can offer the best performance as long as the code is parallelized well.
